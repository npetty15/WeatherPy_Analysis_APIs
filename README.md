# WeatherPy Analysis Using APIs 

## Purpose of Review

I was was asked by Jack to update the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers loved the original setup, but have asked for a few updates. Through using APIs from OpenWeather and Google Maps
- Weather Descriptions
- Creating a Personal Travel Itinery
- Travel Route Informaiton between Several Cities

Through using APIs from OpenWeather and Google Maps I was able to produce the requested updates to the PlanMyTripApp. Some of those examples are below. 
1) Creating a criteria input, where the customer can enter what their desired tempurature would be, bu selecting the max and min.
2) Creating a heat map to show where these cities are throughout the work, and showing them on the map with the closest lodging to that city.
3) Producing an option for the client to create an itinerary based on where they want to go on their trip.
  - Producing the closest hotel per travel destination in the itinerary.
