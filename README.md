# WeatherPy Analysis Using APIs 

## Purpose of Review

I was was asked by Jack to update the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers loved the original setup, but have asked for a few updates.
- Weather Descriptions
- Creating a Personal Travel Itinery
- Travel Route Informaiton between Several Cities

Upon creating these updates from the Beta testers suggestions, hopefully this app will hit the ground running. As this will increase the functionality of the app for users. Being able to pick an entire trip in one sitting will be very beneficial for future sales.
